Cannot Sign in after gmail user and password having no option as irrecoverable verification process
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  My Mobile is Stolen / Lost. Everything working fine until I had upgraded to windows11 Trying to set Google Account on my new Windows11 | Firefox
2.  Stolen/No Access to my Mobile number thus not possible even thru recover 2FA (I don't remember whether 2FA is activated)
3.  As username (email) and password is OK, logged in old Mobile, but had major problem of receiving and sending email thru the Mobile too (Syncing issue, thus no receive or sent email works). However this was ignored, I could not overcome this issue, as I used the same in another Mobile PC
4.  Account is already set in my old Mobile (having no RMN SIM) and trying to recover account from the same with / without 2FA
5.  Tried thru recovery gmail account and verified number of times since month but always returned reply "Sign-in attempt was blocked"
6.  In PC it always redirects Verification to 2FA for Mobile (Not Available) and never opts for recovery gmail, thus verification tried with Mobile only that is in dispute
7.  In Mobile too, Cannot attempt to recover thru ""Try with another Way" so that the option for recovery gmail for verification (having access) could be used.
8.  The Old Mobile account where it is logged in but cannot send or receive the email for which I am trying to resolve it.

Please Note:
a) The usermail and password is working fine, but problem only for 2FA in new upgraded system, whereas the old Mobile too failed thru google recovery gmail (having access) and always opts for Mobile No. (Not Available)
b) As the password is ok, I don't want to take a chance to loose it
